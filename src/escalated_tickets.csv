The subject and description indicate a problem accessing the dashboard after resetting the password, but there is no information in the proposed response that would help resolve this specific login issue. Additionally, contextual keywords such as 'Reset password', 'App not loading', and 'Error code 500' suggest possible relevant steps to troubleshoot, like verifying if the new password was saved correctly, checking if the app is functioning properly, or investigating the cause of error code 500. Therefore, it would be beneficial to include these details in the response for a more accurate solution."
